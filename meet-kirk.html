                            Kirk and his family have been Alpharetta residents for over thirty years. After
                            graduating from Reinhardt University, Kirk began his career in real estate. He started

                            the Greater Atlanta area. The company was purchased by Century 21 in 2017, with whom
                            Kirk still works today.
